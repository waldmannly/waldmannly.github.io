        <b>2022</b><br>
        Over the year and change I have spent at Microsoft, I have found my grove in cloud development working on Azure Compute. 
        I am mainly maintaining, improving, and building upon fabric controller and AzSM which is in charge of the majority
        of virtual machine CRUD operations for the Azure Cloud Platform. Systems have to be available, reliable, fast, and built 
        rock solid as at our scale even the smallest bug could mean many hours lost mitigating livesite incidents. 

        <br><br>
        <b>2021</b><br>
        In the beginning of 2021, I moved out to Seattle, WA to join Microsoft as a Software Engineer to help build out Azure Compute,
        where I constantly pull on my past experiences and learn new things to help develop a robust and easy to use cloud platform.
        

        <br><br>
        <b>2019</b><br>
        In the Fall of 2019 after graduation, I joined Deloitte as a Software Developer out of it's Consulting business. During my year and half 
        at Deloitte, I was able to assist a few projects in various roles ranging from a full stack developer using .NET (C#), SQL, 
        and Angular on a small team making enhancements to an existing website to a lead developer of an API for an AWS and ServiceNow based HR 
        system that involved working closely with business partners and clients to ensure data was being passed back and forth and processed properly. 
        It was the latter role that threw me into the deep end of the cloud and opened my eyes to the very different problems you encounter 
        as a developer when your infrastructure has the ability to scale massively. 
        <br><br>

        In my senior year from Fall 2018 to Spring of 2019, I focused on helping out my peers at UCF.
        As president of the UCF Collegiate Mathematical Society and Director of SIGAI (now AI@UCF), I was able to host 
        workshops and meetings that enabled others to learn new technologies and come together to embrace each other's inner nerd.
        In my role as a Strong Mentor, I assisted three undergraduate transfer students in their first year at UCF where I was 
        meeting with each of them weekly to help them navigate UCF and ensure their success going forward.
        <br><br>

        <b>2018</b><br>
        In the Spring of 2018, my team for COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) received an honorable
        mention for modeling the extinction of languages (Problem B). By incorporating
        existing language competition models and my knowledge of patch-based disease models,
        we made a patch-based language competition model for the top 20 languages that
        converted languages speakers based on the GDP of countries with the chosen languages
        as their official language.  <a href="https://github.com/waldmannly/MCM-ProblemB-2018">Link to Github Repository</a>
        <br><br>
        In the Summer of 2018 I had the amazing chance to research at Harvard Forest
        as part of its REU in Ecology at the Thompson Lab, where I modeled human response to fire across
        Northern California using LANDIS-II. Using the Land Use Plus extension,
        I implemented dynamic human response to fire in R. This consisted of minimizing
        connected fuels across the landscape, post fire salvage logging, and reducing fuels
        around developed areas hit by fire. <a href="https://github.com/hfjtlab/LANDIS_Klamath_REU2018">Link to Github Repository</a>
        <br><br>

        <b>2017</b><br>
        In the Spring of 2017, I started research in soundscape ecology under Jonathan Beever.
        In my work under Dr. Beever, I oversaw data analysis and visualization.
        I also started work on a project about sampling methodology in soundscape ecology. <a href="https://github.com/waldmannly/Soundscape-Ecology-UCF">Link to Github Repository</a>
        <br><br>
        My first internship was at Ellucian in the Summer of 2017 where I was tasked with writing a Java program
        to collect and analyze historical project data to determine a standard time frame for the completion of certain developments
        and integrations. In addition to this analysis, I also assisted in designing an ETL and data migration
        process for upgrading client databases to be compatible with the company's software.
        <br><br>

        <b>2016</b><br>
        One of the first and coolest experiences I was able to have at UCF, was not at UCF. During the Fall of 2016, I participated in UCF's Mathematics
        exchange program with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), where I was able to spend six months living in Melbourne, Australia and
        experiencing different cultures and lifestyles all the while studying math concepts such as Optimization, Modeling, Numerical Methods, and Analysis.
        <br><br>
        When I took Mathematical Biology II at UCF in the Spring of 2016, each student completed a PIC Math
        project in which the goal was to model an aspect of cholera dynamics in Haiti.
        In my project, I devised a socioeconomic class-structured model that captured
        some interesting dynamics of how better access to sanitation reduced the total
        infected populations.  <a href="https://github.com/waldmannly/Cholera-Modeling">Link to Github Repository</a>
